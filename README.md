# SYSC 4806 Project - Group 7

Chosen topic: Amazin Bookstore & FaaS, Microservices, Amazon Lambda

> Bookstore Owner can upload and edit Book information (ISBN, picture, description, author, publisher,...) and inventory. 
> User can search for, and browse through, the books in the bookstore, sort/filter them based on the above information. 
> User can then decide to purchase one or many books by putting them in the Shopping Cart and proceeding to Checkout. 
> The purchase itself will obviously be simulated, but purchases cannot exceed the inventory. 
> User can also view Book Recommendations based on past purchases. 
> This is done by looking for users whose purchases are most similar (using Jaccard distance: Google it!), 
> and then recommending books purchased by those similar users but that the current User hasn't yet purchased.
